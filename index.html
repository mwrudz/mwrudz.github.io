  <p class="indent">I'm a student in Mechanical Engineering at Virginia Tech with an expected graduation date of May 2019. I've been lucky enough to get a broad range of experience in mechanical engineering related fields across multiple co-ops and internships. </p>
  <center><img src="IP_mill.jpg" alt="Paper mill"></center>
  <p class="indent">In the Spring of 2016, I took a co-op in the maintenance department at an International Paper paper mill in Eastover, South Carolina. 
		This was my first experience in real, practical engineering. I was put on projects that diagnosed mechanical issues with the sludge presses and paper machines. My main project was auditing the lubrication routes at the mill. 
		This also had me taking online courses on the importance and specifics of lubrication.</p>
  <p class="indent">Following my co-op at the paper mill, I decided to use my remaining co-op and internship opportunities to investigate and work in jobs that would provide experience in different aspects of engineering. I found a job working at a manufacturing plant for Specialty Product Technologies in Elizabethtown, NC.
		I started off with a co-op in the manufacturing department where I optimized manufacturing efficiencies through Kaizen events (the Japanese idea of continuous improvement). In addition to this, I was allowed the opportunity to completely design a brand new manufacutirng cell. The goal was to 
		create a cell that would follow 5S and improve the building efficiency. The new cell was a success and after a few modifications, it is still used today. </p>
  <p class="indent">After my co-op in the manufacturing department, I was rotated to a summer internship in the new product development department. This gave me the opportunity to use my CAD skills to design new parts to be molded.
		I was able to open the tolerances on plastic parts by implementing crush ribs to their CAD files and subsequently their mold. I also participated in VA/VE events where we worked on money saving projects without spending money.</p>
  <p class="indent">For my last winter break, Virginia Tech gave us 6 weeks off. Since we had such a long time off, I decided to reach out to a local engineering company, Advanced Geolocation Solutions, and I got an internship for my time at home.
		Advanced Geolocation Solutions is a small company that does research and projects with radio frequencies. My job for the winter was to make CAD drawings of many of the parts that they had built for their current "Tora Pod" project, as well as set up SolidWorks PDM.
		Through this, I was able to further improve on my CAD abilities in SolidWorks. </p>

  <p class="indent">My senior design project is the 2Loud car audio competition team at Virginia Tech. I spent the fall semester as the team leader, and we were able to take several strides to improve on last year's team. The competition is all about creating the loudest audio system possible with commercially available audio equipment.
		The 2Loud team has the world record for car audio systems, reaching a top sound pressure level of 163.5 dB. For reference, a jet engine is around 140 dB. This was accomplished within constraints for our competition class, and this decibel level is the world record for our competition class. Going forward, we believe we can improve
		 1.5 dB through relatively phasing the speakers to reach peak amplitude at the microphone, and further sound dampening the car wihtin the confines of the competition.</p>

  <p class="indent"> This website! This is my first experience coding a website. I've been reading tutorials and watching videos to code it in HTML, and I have learned a lot about GitHub and their hosting in order to get this website published.</p>
  <p class="indent"> In addition to coding this website, I've been going through tutorials for Arduinos. I have an Arduino Uno and got a kit with dozens of parts that have shown me different features of the Arduino and how to code it. </p>
